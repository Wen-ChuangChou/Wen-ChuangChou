## 🚗 Welcome to My AI Garage!

This is my hands-on space for building, testing, and sharing AI projects. Here, you'll find a growing collection of my work, complete with code, results, and ongoing experiments.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

Explore some of my completed projects and their impactful outcomes:

1.  **LLM Distillation:** Supervised Fine-Tuning on Distilled Data ([Open-R1](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/open-r1/tree/Qwen2.5-7B_SFT))
2.  **AI Agent:** Agentic RAG Implementation ([Agentic_RAG](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Agentic_RAG/tree/optimize/agent))
3.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Assessing Emotional Tone in Text ([Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/sentiment_analysis))
4.  **Bike Traffic Prediction:** Forecasting Urban Mobility Patterns ([Predict-Bike-Traffic](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Predict-Bike-Traffic))
5.  **Speaker Identification:** Uncovering Voice Patterns ([Speaker Identification](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Speaker-identification))
6.  **Anime Face Generator:** Creating Stylized Character Portraits ([Anime Face Generator](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Anime-face-generator))

### 🛠️ Currently in Progress

I'm actively working on these exciting projects:

1.  **Generative AI - Stable Diffusion:** Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v2 (Stability AI) using LoRA on Naruto images to generate stylized artwork from text prompts.
2.  **Graph Neural Networks - Bike Traffic:** Enhancing Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for improved bike traffic prediction through hyperparameter and architectural optimization.
3.  **Large Language Models - Poetry Generation:** Fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1 (8B and 70B) to generate high-quality poetry.

### 🧪 Seeking Collaboration: Bike Traffic Prediction

I'm currently refining the **Bike Traffic Prediction** project, and I'd love your insights!

🚲 **Why it’s tricky**:  
Cleaning and preprocessing bike traffic data is a critical step. For example, a single road may report **four separate bike flow counts**—two from the bike lanes and two from adjacent pedestrian paths. Defining a *unified traffic instance* along that road is nontrivial and presents one of the core data challenges.

If you have experience with geospatial data cleaning, geometric fusion, or urban mobility analytics, I’d be glad to hear from you!
