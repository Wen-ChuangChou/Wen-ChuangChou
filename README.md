I am interested in AI, particularly in the area of artificial neural networks. I studied theoretical neuroscience in hopes of finding inspiration for how biological neurons interact to implement specific functions. In studying the first olfactory networks, I found that selective inhibition inhibits part of the channels according to input patterns via the recurrent network. Using a non-linear saturating transfer function, I modeled these biological neural networks to explain how to construct attractors of sensory systems, which can less or more separate neuronal patterns during signal propagation. The resulting attractor networks keep systems responsive to intermediate intensity changes and robust enough to be unresponsive to small fluctuations.
