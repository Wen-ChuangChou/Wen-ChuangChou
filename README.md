Welcome to my GitHub garage! Here, I share my code and the outcomes of my machine learning projects.

Explore the following projects I completed and their results: ðŸ”¥  
1. [Speaker Identification](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Speaker-identification)
2. [Anime Face Generator](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Anime-face-generator)
3. [Bike Traffic Prediction](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Predict-Bike-Traffic)
4. [Assess Emotional Tone (Sentiment Analysis)](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/sentiment_analysis)

Currently, I'm working on: ðŸ”¨  
1. Reproducing the training process of [DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/open-r1) on HPC, forked from Hugging Faceâ€™s open repository, to understand its workings and explore potential improvements. ðŸŒ±
2. Optimize Graph Attention Networks hyperparameters and structural elements for bike traffic prediction. :bike:
3. Fine-tuning the Llama-3.1 language model (8B or 70B) to generate high-quality poems :scroll:.  

I'm seeking assistance with the project: ðŸ§ª

Bike Traffic Prediction  
Cleaning the bike data is crucial. For instance, on a main road, there might be four instances of bike traffic: two on the road and two on the pedestrian path. Defining a singular traffic instance along this road poses an initial challenge.

Feel free to reach out for questions or comments. Enjoy your stay! ðŸ˜Š
