## 🚗 Welcome to My GitHub Garage!

Here you'll find a collection of my AI projects—complete with code, results, and ongoing experiments. I treat this space as a hands-on garage where ideas are built, tested, and shared.

### 🚀 Featured Projects
Explore some of the projects I've completed, along with their outcomes:

1. 🔊 [Speaker Identification](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Speaker-identification)  
2. 🎨 [Anime Face Generator](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Anime-face-generator)  
3. 🚴 [Bike Traffic Prediction](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/Predict-Bike-Traffic)  
4. 💬 [Sentiment Analysis: Assessing Emotional Tone](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/sentiment_analysis)  
5. 🔧 [Open-R1 Extension: Fine-tuning and Evaluation Setup](https://github.com/Wen-ChuangChou/open-r1/tree/Qwen2.5-7B_SFT)  
### 🛠️ Currently in Progress
I’m actively working on several exciting projects:

1. 🤖 Building an **agentic RAG system** to answer Hugging Face technical questions—evaluating its performance against standard LLMs with and without RAG integration.  
2. 🌀 Fine-tuning **Stable Diffusion v2** (Stability AI) using **LoRA** on Naruto images to generate stylized artwork from text prompts.  
3. 📊 Enhancing **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** for improved bike traffic prediction through hyperparameter and architectural optimization.  
4. ✍️ Fine-tuning **LLaMA 3.1** (8B and 70B) to generate high-quality poetry.  

### 🧪 Seeking Collaboration: Bike Traffic Prediction

I'm currently refining the **Bike Traffic Prediction** project, and I'd love your insights!

🚲 **Why it’s tricky**:  
Cleaning and preprocessing bike traffic data is a critical step. For example, a single road may report **four separate bike flow counts**—two from the bike lanes and two from adjacent pedestrian paths. Defining a *unified traffic instance* along that road is nontrivial and presents one of the core data challenges.

If you have experience with geospatial data cleaning, geometric fusion, or urban mobility analytics, I’d be glad to hear from you!
